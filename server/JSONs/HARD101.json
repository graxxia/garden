People in the northwoods of MN consider it often as a weed that spreads a lot by underground roots; it is not. It is a beautiful ornamental tree with smooth white bark and good fall color. Some nuseries in northern ILL grow it. I knew of one landscaper from McKay Nursery in southern WI who liked to plant bareroot trees in the Chicago area. I once saw one little spot of a few wild aspens along the \"prairie path\" in Warrenville, IL. Some patches of it are found in southern WI and a lot more in central WI. In the northwoods it lives about 50 to 100 years and grows about 2 to 4 feet/year. It is short-lived in the Chicago area of ab... read more\nPositive\nOn Aug 28, 2012, Nkytree from Burlington, KY wrote:\nThe new cultivar 'Prairie Gold' from southeastern Nebraska, and released by the Nebraska Statewide Arboretum has proven to be well adapted to lower elevation conditions. I have trialed it at my home, and a nearby Arboretum is also trying in our local climate. So far, so good.\nAspens are best in natural areas as groves. The root systems should never be distrubed as this encourages suckering. Few if any other trees can offer the visual and audible impact that an aspen can on a windy day. They are truly facinating to see and hear.\nNeutral\nOn Aug 29, 2011, Larch16 from Kamloops, BC (Zone 5a) wrote:\nBeautiful trees especially when the wind blows through the leaves. Very fast growing so they make a great tree when a tree is needed quick. However, the new trees coming off the roots will take over even after being cut back year after year. The sap also attracts wasps and hornets.\nNegative\nOn Jun 28, 2011, BoPo from Milwaukee, WI (Zone 5b) wrote:\nYes, this is a very fast growing tree. Like a WEED. It will send runners all over your yard, your neighbors yard, and your neighbors neighbors yard. It will send shoots around your yard and planting beds that you will have to mow and pull out unless you want more trees. Every where you dig, you will run into its roots.\nThis plant is a weed. A huge mistake for 1st time homeowners who didn't know any better. Don't plant it. EVER.\nThey are known to hollow out with age, making it weak, which is a liability when planted near any home or any structure.\nIf you care for the foundation of your home, the integrity of your soil, the life span of your planting beds or your lawn, your relationship with your neighbors, keep this tree out of your nei... read more\nPositive\nOn Aug 4, 2010, jimbodw07 from Pinon Hills, CA (Zone 8a) wrote:\nAspen trees are quite hardy!

Can be considered invasive as it suckers, but the suckers are easily removed with a quick tug. If you have room to let it go, you will have a nice grove of trees in a few years. Especially good on hillsides.The leaves shimmer in the slightest breeze which looks pretty and sounds wonderful. Has golden fall color. The pale grey bark is attractive in winter. Withstands almost any soil moisture level. One word of warning; keep this and all poplars away form water pipes, their roots will invade them. This tree is fairly short lived.\nPost a comment about this plant"

It is common in Southcentral Alaska on dry, rocky, open sub-alpine and alpine slopes. It grows all the way down to sea level along the Seward Hwy. South of Anchorage, AK. Common name is Prickly Saxifrage, because the leaves become sharp and prickly during dry periods. In cold weather the leaves turn red. The flower petals have a complex pattern of tiny spots. It is an excellent rock garden plant.\nNeutral\nOn Dec 1, 2004, Todd_Boland from St. John's, NL (Zone 5b) wrote:\nThis species is native primarily to the high Arctic, where they are actually quite common growing among cracks in the rocks. The rosettes are stiff, deep green with three 'teeth' at the tips. They are closely related to S. bronchialis, which is quite common in alpine areas of the Rockies. Like the latter species, they are difficult in cultivation, simply because any heat will kill them. They are adpated to summers where the temperature rarely rises above 60 F.

I have liverwort growing in an area that routinely floods and is in shade at all times. It can look unsightly but as far as I know, it does not harm any neighbouring plants. The only problem is that it can form a tight mat on the soil surface, preventing the seedlings of other plants from emerging.

I collected seeds of this at Guanella Pass, Colorado, well above the tree-line. Once it bloomed, I was able to ID it and discovered this species extends from the Rockies of Colorado north to Alaska, Yukon and right up to Ellesmere Island at the northernmost tip of the Canadian Arctic. They even occur in Greenland. Hardy to zone1! Amazing!\nPost a comment about this plant"

I do not know, however, how much it might complain about alkaline sites (such as fens and limestone pond margins).\nThe kidney shaped leaves are fairly distinctive, but whether they are a useful differentiator depends on where you are - ie. what other species there are as candidates. In the UK, for instance, there is only one violet with kidney-shaped leaves - this one.\nIt will grow in moss and wet grass, and stands competition surprisingly well. It loses its leaves in winter, and spreads by runners as well as seed. ... read more\nPost a comment about this plant"
