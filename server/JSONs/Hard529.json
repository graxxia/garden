A quick internet search would bring up plenty of data that the raphides in Virginia Creeper (and other plants such as Agave and Dieffenbachia) can cause a horrible reaction in some people.\nI found this out the hard way. I am well schooled in what poison ivy looks like - I have traipsed through it my entire life and am lucky enough to not be reactive. I didn't know Virginia Creeper could be dangerous - highly in part because many people irresponsibly label it as 'harmless' on gardening sites. I live in Virginia - we have lots of creeper here.

When I encountered it, I thought it was poison ivy, but the rash was not quite the same. Each time I have broken out I have a second reaction two or three months later with no additional contact. I am wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience. My theory is that some of the calcium oxalate crystals remain within the skin and after a period of time begin to cause more itching and when scratched, a full reaction occurs. Can anyone confirm this, or explain why a second reaction could occur with no re-exposure?\nNegative\nOn Feb 16, 2016, AbitaBB from New Orleans, LA wrote:\nIt is a beautiful vine, however it is the epitome of \"careful what you wish for\" - the sap will make many breakout like poison ivy and it's every bit as invasive as poison ivy complete with little tendrils that will drill in wood, stucco, and more, leaving minute holes that eventually cause problem. I've had it invade several places I've lived and I would NEVER invite the plant unless in a stainless plant pot with no drainage holes. It spreads by root, will choke out most plantings if allowed to move in. It will absolutely strangle a landscape.

It was a very hot, humid day and I kept brushing the sweat off my face with my bare hands--yes, stupid, I know! A few days later, I broke out into the worst itchy rash I've ever had in my life. It was everywhere that I'd touched my hands to my skin before taking a shower--including all over my face and neck.

However, like most vines, including those sold at nurseries as wisterias, trumpetvines, small-flowered clematis, English-Ivy, etc., It is best in landscapes to keep vines isolated from other plants, buildings, and other stuff on a fence or trellis surrounded by lawn or mulch with nothing else growing in it. I have never had any bad reaction to touching this species, but some have reported bad allergic reactions. Its 5-leaflet compound leaves are different from the thicker, shinier, 3-leaflet compound leaves of Poison-Ivy, though very young Virginia Creepers can have some three-parted leaves for awhile.\nPositive\nOn Oct 3, 2013, Daphne36 from Cushing, ME wrote:\nOMg (oh my goodness)!

How much healthier to allow some of this plant to grow than to feed them from a crowded feeder where diseases can be spread.

There is a correct time and way to use Round Up with any plant/weed that spreads by underground roots rhizomes etc. You have to use a broad leaf herbicide in the spring to stop growth and any flower and then seeds. The fall is the best time to use R.U. it is better sucked down into the roots at that time. It still will take a few applications(seasons)..I'm fighting Wisteria too.\nBroad leaf herbicides would work too..need repeated applications ..they are less money than Round UP.\nRound Up does not go into the ground water. You can plant seeds days after application of Round UP.\nPositive\nOn Jul 3, 2017, susanstevens from Lakeside, MI wrote:\n1. the strong odor appears to deter deer.

I have been growing purple cone flower for about 3 years. As a novice, it has been very easy to care for and looks great for so long! It comes back strong every year and has not been invasive in my raised flowerbed. I have seen different color varieties and plan to plant it along my back fence.\nPositive\nOn Jul 23, 2016, NativeGarden86 from Saint Petersburg, FL wrote:\nLove the many uses of this plant! The butterflies also love it!! I have had a few of them over the past few years. They DO NOT like a lot of water. We had rain for almost 30 days straight in SW Florida and the ones I had in the ground all perished. Now I keep them all in pots just in case. Overall a beautiful, useful plant. The blooms are so big and I love how they age. A must have for any herbalists or people interested in traditional medicinals.\nPositive\nOn Feb 1, 2016, JBtheExplorer from Southeast, WI wrote:\nThis is a great plant, with a great color. It attracts butterflies, including Monarchs. Make sure you have the true specie and not a garden center variety! As many know, this plant looks great with rudbeckia, however, it also looks great next to Asclepias tuberosa (Orange Milkweed) as well as Gaillardia. This plant should be added to all butterfly gardens, pollinator gardens, and native gardens in its native range.\nNeutral\nOn Apr 16, 2015, marlene67 from Indianapolis, IN wrote:\nhaven't tried to grow it, but in researching it, learned it can cause allergic reactions if ingested.\nPositive\nOn Jun 14, 2014, coriaceous from ROSLINDALE, MA wrote:\nThis is usually called purple coneflower.\nTough, easy, adaptable, and long-blooming, this is a great garden plant. The flowers are butterfly magnets, and they make good cut flowers, in white, shades of pink, or green. Flower arrangers sometimes remove the petals and use the orangey-brown cone.\nThis is a short-lived, clump-forming perennial that persists in the garden through self-sowing. It isn't weedy or aggressive in its self-sowing, and extra plants are easily removed. Individual plants typically live 3-5 years, and are often replaced by their offspring unnoticed. Good drainage is essential.\nThe petals of the species usually droop, giving the flower a shape like a badminton shuttlecock. If you don't like the droopy look, 'Magnus' holds its pe... read more\nPositive\nOn Apr 22, 2014, kmm44 from Dayton, OH wrote:\nI absolutely love this plant. I think my originals were given to me by my son. I had decided to quit doing the same boring annuals every year and branch out into perennials and didn't know where to start. He had taken botany as part of his biology degree studies and was gung ho on helping me. He was living with his brother an hour from here and had planted several flower beds in his yard. He brought me starts of countless plants and showed me how to arrange them by height and color. My coneflowers are prolific, but I don't consider them invasive--they are too beautiful!. They do have a tendency to pop up in other beds, but I just leave them. I had some in another bed and dug them up to give my sister-in-law and next thing I knew, they all grew back from whatever root bits were left,... read more\nPositive\nOn Feb 6, 2014, Rickwebb from Downingtown, PA wrote:\nOne of my very favorite perennials that is easy, reliable, and does not need staking. This native plant is commonly sold at most garden centers in the Midwest and East USA. It can experience Aster Yellows disease, a mycoplasma spread by leafhoppers, that disfigures the flowers and upper leaves. Cut way below the infection and burn the diseased part. This plant does self sow a lot. I have one patch that appeared by itself about 20 feet from the closest ones I planted years earlier. It is easy to dig up and divide to propagate more, besides seeding. It blooms a long time, usually about 6 weeks for me in late June to early August.\nPositive\nOn Jun 23, 2013, plant_it from Valparaiso, IN wrote:\nA butterfly magnet! This is one of the Top 3 nectar-bearing food plants for butterflies. (The other two are butterfly weed & New England aster). Butterfly visitors include Monarchs, Fritillaries, Painted Ladies, Swallowtails, Sulfurs, and Whites.\nThe caterpillars of the butterfly Chlosyne nycteis (Silvery Checkerspot) feed on the foliage, while the caterpillars of several moths feed on the flowerheads. These latter species include Chlorochlamys chloroleucaria (Blackberry Looper), Eupithecia miserulata (Common Eupithecia), Synchlora aerata (Wavy-Lined Emerald), and Homoeosoma electella (Sunflower Moth).\nA small songbird, the Eastern Goldfinch, eats the seeds during the summer and early fall.\nIf you can grow this plant, nature will reward you ma... read more\nPositive\nOn Apr 23, 2013, debles from Tulsa, OK wrote:\nOne of my all-time favorite plants. The area where I had previously grown it has been redone and I lost me ever-growing cluster of plants, so I'm starting over in another area.\nIn our hot, often dry climate, it thrives with little to no care, blooms for a long time, pleases the butterflies and birds and is a valuable source of medicine. What's not to love?\nNeutral\nOn Jun 7, 2012, MsMuddyToes from Kansas City, MO wrote:\nI have several different cultivars in my garden. My first plants did not do so well. I moved them, even one that looked like it was dying every year. A tree had made the \"sunny\" only partial shade. Once in the sun, it grew well. I obtained another native (for this area) cultivar, but the gal couldn't remember the exact name. I finally have a plant the spreads if I allow it to. I use tomato cages to hold it up as it gets very tall. We love it, but it does not like to be crowded by other plants and really windy storms will knock it over if not supported.\nPositive\nOn Apr 22, 2011, jazzy1okc from Oklahoma City, OK wrote:\nThis plant is even more reliable than Black Eyed Susans in my OKC zone 7a yard. Withstands cold, humidity, heat, and drought well. It's only enemies seem to be a leafeating larvae that sometimes appears. But they bounce back well if that happens and I can catch the larvae before they decimate the plant completely.\nThey do self seed occasionally but I've had good luck transplanting the babies in early spring. I experimented with the dwarf varieties but prefer the older, taller varieties as they seem less likely to mutate and produce weirdly contorted flower heads.\nPositive\nOn Apr 18, 2011, califaloha from San Rafael, CA wrote:\nI love Echinacea. Even the seedheads are pretty. My only problem are the squirrels love to dig them out of the pots on my deck and eat them. Little buggers. I cover my pots that contain tasty things they like with chicken wire until they are far enough along that the rodents leave them alone.\nPositive\nOn Jul 13, 2010, Clary from Lewisburg, PA (Zone 6b) wrote:\nThese smell wonderful, tolerate heat and drought, survive rain and humidity, rebound from difficult winters, maintain a full clump of green foliage for the entire season, bloom for months, attract butterflies, feed the goldfinches, and multiply every year. They're a native plant and have a lovely bright color too.\nPositive\nOn Dec 12, 2009, HummingbirdDude from Whitehall, PA wrote:\nNice plant, easy to grow. Butterflies, bees, and birds like this plant. Leave the stalks up after blooming so that the birds can eat the seeds. I have seen goldfinches eat the seeds from these plants.\nNeutral\nOn Nov 11, 2008, mjsponies from DeLand/Deleon Springs, FL (Zone 8b) wrote:\nI bought 3 Purple Coneflowers from Lowe's about 6 weeks ago. Planted them where they get full sun. They aren't doing ANYTHING. Haven't died, haven't grown. Mayyyyybeee 1 or 2 tiny little new leaves.

I have literally had to dig up, at last count, 18 plants! But, I will still keep growing these.\nPositive\nOn May 5, 2008, dwdessauer from Los Alamos, NM wrote:\nGrows well in high altitude, dry New Mexico. Great fresh cut flowers for vases. Cut off long seed heads for dry flower arrangement. I have the style of can opener that takes off the entire can top (no sharp edges.) Collected seeds and placed in used clean cans. Taped down the top, printed a label \"Vivian's Drought Tolerant Flower Seeds.\" Made unique Christmas gifts and party favors. Seeds are a favorite of local birds.\nPositive\nOn Feb 18, 2008, jestelleoan from Tyler, TX (Zone 8a) wrote:\nThis is a wonderful work horse plant. Does well in full sun and shade. All most bug free but birds love the seed. My yard is mostly shade and if I can get it a little sun it will grow. Their are so many colors now and doubles that you can find a good color for your garden.\nPositive\nOn Oct 27, 2007, creekwalker from Benton County, MO (Zone 5a) wrote:\nBefore finding out that drinking green tea daily wards off colds, I would make a vodka tincture of this plant, a couple of dropperfuls taken at the first sign of a cold would almost always make it go away.\nI never used the roots, even though most believe that they are where the strongest concentration of good things are, and just used the stems, leaves and flowers. It was plenty good and far better than any commercial preparation.\nI love the plant and yes, it does self seed, but I never had any trouble with it being invasive.\nNeutral\nOn Sep 24, 2007, ettasplace from Elizabethton, TN wrote:\nI love the flower, but mine have been planted for 3 years and have never looked healthy.

When I first started my garden a lady gave me a couple of clumps of these purple coneflowers. I couldnt believe she was giving them away.She did warn me about the fact that they spread like weeds.(I really didnt believe her). Those original 2 clumps turned out to be about 50 mature plants.This plant looks good paired with russian sage and black eyed susans. This is a great starter plant , when you are on a budget. It will fill up your garden and look good untill you can afford different varieties of plants and then you can pass some of them on to someone else. They can be a bit invasive, but you just have to learn to pull out the young ones like weeks if you cant find someone to take them off your hands.\nNeutral\nOn Mar 9, 2006, billyporter from Nichols, IA (Zone 5a) wrote:\nI like purple coneflower, but in the hot Iowa sun the color fades.

Turns black when rainfall is abundant, though it does come back. Both years I've only gotten four or five flowers. No problems at all with it being invasive. Can kill it with love, put it somewhere where you won't 'accidentally' water it!\nNeutral\nOn Mar 10, 2005, NanaSue000 from St. Augustine, FL (Zone 9a) wrote:\nI do love this flower, it can take the hot Florida summer sun unlike many things we try to grow here. But alas, much like black-eyed-susans, they are prone to fungus in our area. The humidity here tends to kill off otherwise heat-hardy plants, except for gaillardia of course. Fortunately, echinacea reseeds, so even while some of my flowers have to be pulled out if it's been especially rainy or humid, there are always new ones on the way.\nPositive\nOn Aug 4, 2004, PurplePansies from Deal, NJ (Zone 7a) wrote:\nAlways beautiful..... always easy...... the new or fairly new must for the garden...... will be a classic one day like roses...... well maybe not like roses but close..... newer cultivars coming out every day...... while many new cultivars are bred to be brighter or different colors....... the white I can appreciate.......

Good for the birds and bees :) !!!!! ........ Personally I'll always like the wilder form original best...... the paler purple and the droopy blossoms...... with all the new cultivars out there.......I advise all those to keep theres someday they may be something of a novelty........ read more\nNeutral\nOn Jul 14, 2004, CaptMicha from Brookeville, MD (Zone 7a) wrote:\nMy purple coneflowers started from one nursery bought plant and spread rapidly in my butterfly garden which has very fertile soil and full sun. It seems to be very happy and blooms over a long length of time, although the color was never very rich to begin with and the plant probably never reached it's full potenial because the petals are always detroyed by japanese beetles... but the foliage remains untouched.\nMostly smaller butterflies are drawn to this plant and of course bees and other small pollinaters along with beetles. Birds LOVE the seeds and I often can't find a single one left on the plant.\nOverall, this plant is great as a nectar source, landscape plant, and seed for birds.\nPositive\nOn May 3, 2004, melody from Benton, KY (Zone 7a) wrote:\nEasy and carefree, this plant is popular with butterflies and birds. I enjoy them so much in my garden. They do reseed with abandon, but as I have them in a 'wildflower' section, this only adds to their charm.

It comes back stronger and stronger every year. I do have to remove small plants each year as it tends to take over the island that I have it planted on.

Very hardy, does fine with just rain water, grows well in rocky soil & hillside. Beautiful in a vase. Bloom lasts forever!

(semi-upstate New York, in a cold cleft of Stormville Mtn.) I am actually trying to find out whether the white is echinacea herb also, as I have more white than purple and put the leaves in my tea. It is not invasive (we have a problem though with sweet woodruff!) and flowers beautifully. Great for the tricky hotspots. Oh, and the deer seem to leave it alone, which is another plus for us!\nPositive\nOn Jul 26, 2002, Abutilon from Coal Center, PA (Zone 6a) wrote:\nBlooms well and long late spring through fall.

The bog liner helps keep control, but it still needs to be maintained. Every spring, I pull out 3/4 of it, knowing that it will all regrow by the end of the season. I also make sure none of it escapes the bog. In my situation, it's fairly easy to control. I have never seen it spread by spores and have never had it pop up anywhere else.

These plants are great for extremely restricted areas of as little as a few inches, such as may exist between a sidewalk and a wall. If stems become damaged it may be best to prune to just above ground level. Pruning higher on the stem will joint into multiple new stems and may make your plant top-heavy.

When we moved to this land in West Virginia, our clearing was ringed with redbuds, wild trees. So lovely in bloom...I don't think anyone has mentioned that some years the seedpods are an eyecatching red color. The issue for me has been, not how to keep them healthy or get them to bloom, but how to avoid cutting too many for various reasons. This is a leguminous tree, but there seems to be argument as to whether it fixes nitrogen. But I favor it around most of my clearing because it thrives on the slope below the clearing--not everything does well on steep, heavy clay--and because it never gets more than fifteen or twenty feet tall, so it can do the bank-holding, soil-improving services (not to mention the spring bloom) without ... read more\nPositive\nOn Mar 28, 2016, NCMstGardener from Columbus, NC (Zone 7b) wrote:\nThe number of new cultivars of Cericis Canadensis is staggering.

I did have to spray it for rust during one summer long ago but that was it, so it is a tough little tree.\nI would recommend it if you want a small ornamental tree, but it does have a few of draw backs. It contains a lot of dead limbs that have to be regularly pruned out. Because of the dead wood, it also drops twigs quite a bit, and it is susceptible to rust. If you don't mind spraying it with a fungicide every few years, or pruning it each summer, or raking twigs out from under it each fall, then it would make a great small tree for... read more\nPositive\nOn Aug 16, 2010, worms4compost from Leicester, NC (Zone 7a) wrote:\nSome have grown quite well, some not so well.

It covered the slope, controled the erosion and looks really lovely.

It spreads by mere filament roots which eventually start new root areas which must be dug out.

But when these gems are in its full blooms. Behold; beauty and pure. The rest of the growing season.

They always bloom profusely right after the last frost and then shower the ground with petals which can wait a bit before being picked up - they're pretty. The leaves are large and bright green - very attractive and distinctive. I've never seen the problems that other posters have indicated. Maybe my hardiness zone is better for them, even though it's colder.\nNegative\nOn Feb 24, 2006, escambiaguy from Atmore, AL (Zone 8b) wrote:\nI agree with the previous statement about this tree blooming too early. I have even seen them starting to bloom in the fall after shedding its leaves, only to have the frost get them. While the tree may be pretty in bloom, I think its just an ugly tree the rest of the year. The foliage is a light green which always looks like it has chlorosis. Plus, it looks more like a bush than a tree.\nNegative\nOn Dec 3, 2005, ineedacupoftea from Denver, CO wrote:\nI'm actaully giving this beautiful tree a negative rating because of its propensity to bloom suicidally before the last frost. Years of failure due to late frosts have been written from 1 in five to 1 in 3 years. I would also not give it a negative rating were there not a grand range of new cultivars that bloom just late enough to miss turning into a spring tree of brown rags. But ther are many out there. I do give it credit for being adaptable to extreme, even dry, soils, and being a bloomer at a very young age.\nThis is a tree for patient and forgiving gardeners unlike myself; dug mine up (gave it away) and supplanted it with a different Magnolia.\nPositive\nOn Jul 4, 2004, Pameladragon from Appomattox, VA wrote:\nAbout 10 years ago I found an unusual M. soulangiana, all purple flowers, in a batch of the species. The tree has thrived in central Virginia and will put on a second bloom in late June-July when the tree is fully leafed out.

The flowers can be 4-5 inches across and have white to pink coloration from the center outward to the tip of the petal.\nOur tree had another tree fall on it just before we moved into our house and, although it has recovered nicely, the shape of the tree will never be the same. It seemed to send up \"suckers\" from the existing branches.\nNeutral\nOn Jan 25, 2002, Terry from Murfreesboro, TN (Zone 7a) wrote:\nThe common name \"Tulip Tree\" is a misnomer. M. soulangiana is a deciduous tree, with beautiful pink blossoms in early spring, before leafing out.\nPlant in a protected spot, ideally with partial sun and good air flow to prevent disease. This shrub is a beautiful harbinger of spring in any garden, although the blooming may be sporadic in colder climates, where a late frost is likely.\nPost a comment about this plant"

When I came across some 5 gal plants with poor color (totally grey in the trunk and barely pink at the new twigs), the grower tried to convince me that they need to grow to 15 gal size before the color intensifies.

My strategy for this fall is to transplant two natives, Ruellia humillis and Euphorbia corollata (Google or go to Prairie Moon Nursery for info. & pics) around them for protection. Latex in the Euphobia repels deer, and I've had no browsing on my Ruellia. The three complement one another with staggered heights and similar bloom times, not to mention handsome colors.

Shearing it is OK for the first spring following planting when it puts on new growth, but I would encourage you to cut it back to about 10\" the following year, making sure to leave some branches where you can actually see new leaf growth appearing below it. If you cut it back below the area of new growth or if you cut it back too soon, it may well die. I let mine go with shearing an additional year, but it was so woody that I was really sick of it by the following year. Don't cut it back in the fall.

Mine serves as an understorey for roses, and perennials that tend to get leggy. It throws out long (2-4') stems that can go bare at the center as the long summer in Florida (USDA zone 9a) comes to an end. The upside to this growth habit is that you can air-weave (propagate) these long, leggy stems by slightly abrading the stem and burying it (I use a landscaping staple, but a y-shaped stick would do the trick). Can unify a bed. Not at all invasive like Silver King, another cultivar of Artemisia.\nHighest recommendation for a low-care, foliage plant in an annual or perennial bed where, say, lambs ear wouldn't survive.\nNegative\nOn Sep 1, 2004, donp17 from Arlington, VA wrote:\nMy first year with this plant, having installed 4\" pots, was very good.

Peach-leaved bellflowers will grow in full sun and are equally happy in partial shade.

The smell is incredible and makes great dried flowers.

Ten years ago it was just a little four inch potted herb. It is now five feet across and I have had to prune it severly several times in the last ten years. Although lavender is a drought tolerant plant, mine gets fertilized as often as the rest of the garden and when it is blooming, I keep it watered. So mine gets a far denser mass of blooms than it would otherwise. After I cut all of the first bloom off, I continue to keep it watered and fed while the weather is still warm because it will continue to put out new flower spikes. Never as much as the first time of the year, but the bees certainly appreciate it's continued offerings.\nPositive\nOn Apr 14, 2009, purplesun from Krapets,\nBulgaria (Zone 8a) wrote:\nThis is one of my favourite plants. It is quick growing, fragrant, beautiful, and attracts bees.\nI grow it both in Krapets, Bulgaria (zone 7b) on the Black Sea coast, and in a container in Sofia, Bulgaria (zone 6b) at 2300 feet AMSL. It is excellent in both acid and alkaline soils, although it is most at home in alkaline soils.\nEver since I started growing English Lavender, I have tried to plant as many plants as my garden would contain. I even planted six of them around a Hardy Japanese Orange and think the combination of the hanging yellow citrus fruit and the upright spikes of English Lavender will look fantastic.\nAnd, as an additional asset, the flower spikes can be harvested and put into cloth bags in your wardrobe to act as an excellent moth repellent.\nPositive\nOn Apr 13, 2009, zone3gardener from Ely, MN wrote:\nI am in northern MN and have had great success with my lavender.

They've taken some time to establish themselves, but this year they took off and are blooming beautifully--the bright white of their blooms in full summer is truly eye-catching. I look forward to the dusky rose shade they will turn later this fall. All four are in full sunlight, and all have shown good heat tolerance in 100-degree days during July. My big-leaf hydrangeas droop and don't look very happy in the heat, but Limelights are troopers! I mulch them with prairie hay for the winter, but even if I didn't, I believe they would easily survive our zero and below temps during January and February.\nNegative\nOn Aug 19, 2015, Rickwebb from Downingtown, PA wrote:\nThis cultivar is relatively new on the market and is very popular in southeast PA and many other regions.

The dark purple leaves emerge lime green, and not one leaf has browned, wilted, or been eaten (yet). This would be also beautiful in groups or a line (for screening or a very loose hedge).\nPositive\nOn Mar 14, 2007, braun06 from Peoria Heights, IL (Zone 5b) wrote:\nI like this plant more than I thought I would. It has a great character that is different from plant to plant. It does retain a black color here in our summers and grows quite fast. Its a trouble free beautiful plant I think its uses are endless for those looking for something different. I don't like norway maples for various reasons. I don't like red norways because the size of the plant size and leaf make it stand out too much and draw too much attention from everything else in a landscape. Black Lace is very versatile and offers something different in the landscape but does so conservatively. I dont doubt this plant will wind up in overuse at some point though because of its character and carefree culture.

Spring snowflakes have one flower per stem (or in some uncommon varieties, two), and their foliage is generally no more than 6-8\" tall.

Does fine in rocky hillside soil; excellent for holding soil on a slope, and much prettier than grass in areas that can't be mowed. EXCELLENT for rock retaining walls. It constantly resupplies itself - once you start this, you'll have an ENDLESS supply.

I would not put it in my garden, and I happily mow down the ones on my lawn, but I still have them wherever I can't reach the grass, along the road, etc. The nice thing about them is they are really tough, and if you do grow them, they're like echinacea, black-eyed susan, etc. needing no care at all.

At first the jury was out, as it seems leggy and spindly. But it attracts bees and butterflies enmasse. The honeybees and smaller bees are successful in their gathering, but sometime a bumblebee will be on a bloom, and if it is in it's second day of bloom, the petals and bee will fall.

The advantage of the raking is that the structure of the plant is maintained, the blue blades remain and only the dead blades come out easily. I do cut the oat tips back and neaten up the plant after it blooms but I always try to keep the structure of the plant.

It will, however, self sow, and you may find seedlings coming up elsewhere if the conditions are favorable. If what you think is blue oat grass has been growing unchecked in your garden, it isn't blue oat grass. Perhaps it was mis-labeled, and you actually have a different plant. Elymus (or Leymus), wild rye, is of similar color, but different form and does indeed spread aggressively.

I transplanted four clumps to an open, sunny spot in my flower garden, and I now enjoy dozens of bright, healthy blooms each year, rather than the one or two small and puny ones that struggled to bloom before.

I have several. Absolutely reliable, never had a problem with them. Heavy bloomers and so can cut enough for a decent bouquet without seriously reducing the display in the garden. Only real drawback is that like most double peonies it really needs a ring to hold it up.

Plants are fairly resistant to blights and disease. Plant in well drained soil in full sun (northern states only) or partial shade. Will take full shade but will not flower as well. Give plenty of water prior to bloom time\nWhen planting for the first time, make sure eyes of the plant are no more than 1 to 1 1/2 \" below the soil line. Very hardy.\nI grow several of these peony bushes to cut for dried flower arrangements. Usually drys well except in very wet years - will sometimes go slightly brown when drying.\nPost a comment about this plant"

The bloom is decent as well and attracts many small pollinators. Ours is planted in a part shade location and gets powdery mildew every year right after it's finished blooming. Easily divided but you need to dig out a chunk as the stems don't hold up well if separated from the root mass. I transplanted a bunch late last season.

I suspect something to do with the pecan tree blossums falling 20 feet away, which blow into the Zagrebs. In mid June they roar into flower, giving me many months of bright yellow bloom.

It grew and bloomed with no attention at all. About 5 years ago I filled in the pond and left the plant in place as it was well rooted. It continues to multiply at a faster rate now that it is planted in the ground. It does send runners underground. The only real problem is if you water from the top the limbs will fall over and usually will not stand up again. It is truly a carefree plant.\nPositive\nOn May 23, 2014, Fires_in_motion from Vacherie, LA (Zone 9a) wrote:\nI grow mine in a plastic pot with no holes at the bottom to create a nice soggy mush in which it can live. I'm surprised to see people calling it invasive, since mine has grown only a few inches in the two years since I dug it up in Tickfaw. This time of year (May) you can see them blooming in ditches and canals around my area, namely the River Parishes of Louisiana. The most amazing stand of it I've seen is at the St. James welcome center on Airline Highway in Gramercy, La. Just a cool and elegant plant which I highly recommend. And it has five u's in its Latin name, which has to be some kind of record.\nPositive\nOn Apr 25, 2013, PammiePi from Green Cove Springs, FL wrote:\nI love this plant! I have a clump of these growing amongst the fern in a damp part of my yard, near my natural spring. It grows in filtered sunlight & has very attractive flowers and leaves.

If your in to butterfly gardening this plant is also attractive to catipillars. My plant is often defoliated as the larvae consume all of the leaves.

It has performed well in gardens and ponds of mine in northen and southern parts of the state. Grow in pots in a pond, or in perminent locations in bog or waters edge. Makes a striking cascade down the side of a waterfall.\nPositive\nOn Aug 8, 2001, Terry from Murfreesboro, TN (Zone 7a) wrote:\nLizard's Tail is a native to the Eastern half of the U.S. It blooms in the shade, a rare trait among water plants. Very easy to grow, it thrives on the edges of shallow water or in a boggy setting.

This leaves a gap in the border. Most gardeners deal with this by planting near the rear of the border and covering the gap with annuals or late-rising perennials around it. (Boltonia and Gypsophila are traditional, but I prefer herbaceous Hibiscus or Euphorbia corollata or Lespedeza thunbergii.) Some foliage will re-emerge in early fall. Best planted in late summer while dormant.\nAs the \"regional\" list above shows, this is a plant of the north and can't tolerate the hot humid summers and short winters south of Z7 in eastern North America.

It's growing well but shortly after it starts to bloom it rains and the leaves start turning black and curling up. Last year I removed the affected leaves as soon as I noticed them and cut the plant back to the ground once it quit blooming. It's doing the same thing again this year. I will try making a waterproof cover above it but would appreciate any better suggestions.

They have a short, marvellous bloom season in mid June. Huge, crepe papery red petals with black blotches. I also have some white ones with purple blotches. In July the foliage dries up. It is good to have late blooming perennials or annuals nearby, like asters, to fill in the gap. Later when it is cool again, a foliage clump appears and overwinters.\nThey grow in full or part sun, good or poor soil, need moderate water in spring but none in summer. They reseed, but not too much. The seedlings dont transplant well.\nPositive\nOn Feb 9, 2009, JonthanJ from Logansport, IN wrote:\nThere are two seriously different kinds of Oriental Poppies in American gardens. Most varieties are clumpers that have deep taproots and require good drainage and deep soils. A much smaller group of varieties is made up of turfers that spread through the top foot of even clay loam soils by means of stolons. As you might expect this second group survives conditions that kill the members of the first group pretty quickly. The most common of the turfers is an orange double, with no dark blotch at the base of the petal and a relatively small seed pod, that is frequently seen in Indiana as a broad bed of some considerable age. Plants that my Aunt Pearl set out in the 1950's continue to bloom.

They will tolerate dry sandy soils when grown in very shady sites but will be happier with a site that gets moisture regularly but never stays wet. Sandy slopes under a mixture of pines and oaks tends to work be best. I have seen them growing quite happily under pines in dry (rarely moist) slopes.

Mainstream nurserys are unable to get it. If you do find it, make sure it says Cersis Occidentalis on the tag. Some claim Western Redbud, yet they aren't.

Bulbs can be dug as plant is going dormant, dried, and planted in fall in new location. They can also be dug with soil ball intact around roots as they are beginning to emerge. This is the method most likely to succeed, but typically the flowering cycle is disrupted for up to several years.\nAs seed is setting, flexible stem bends to the ground, and seedheads must be wrapped, otherwise seed immediately is dispersed to the soil below when it is ripe.

It is visited by a lot of birds, too.\nMy one precaution is that when you get to zone 9 or so, it can get stressed during the hottest times of the summer if not planted on a wet site. Ours isn't planted on a wet site and it does droop sometimes-- this is why you usually only see it growing wild here in disturbed swampier areas.\nPositive\nOn Jan 24, 2014, Rickwebb from Downingtown, PA wrote:\nIt is a handsome and common tree. Lots of wild trees all over the place in southeast PA and the mid-Atlantic. It is planted a lot in northern Illinois and it does not grow wild there, but stops in the slightly acid soils of Indiana. Mostly of the trees planted in northern IL are the cultivars that ensure red autumn color, for the straight species usually has yellow fall color in rich silty or clay soils and usually red in sandy, less fertile soils as in New England. I'm not sure where the breaking point is of when the tree gets magnesium and other micronutrient defiency in alkaline soils. I know it does well in pH 6.9 and 7.0.

Now they are about 3 feet tall and I was able to plant them with the others in the western edge of the yard to fill in the gaps.\nSome may consider them a pain as they do release thousands of \"helicopter\" seeds that sprout EVERYWHERE in the lawn.

While an alternate name for this tree is \"swamp maple\", that's a misnomer, because they don't do well in wet areas.\nTo save yellowed trees, add granulated sulfur to make the soil less alkaline, and add more manganese to the soil. Five pound bags of sulfur are available at garden stores, while agricultural supply stores sell bigger bags. Manganese sulfate powder is available from several sources on Ebay, or palm tree fertilizer will have manganese. I've used this sulfur and manganese treatment to green up two red maples that were badly yellowed.\nPositive\nOn Sep 7, 2009, cloverlymd from Silver Spring, MD wrote:\nOften brittle and sometimes short-lived, and like most maples it throws hundreds of seedlings. That said, it's one of the more desirable maples for the mid-Atlantic. The fall color rivals that of the sugar maple, and the shade is not so dense.

Mine has been transplanted twice in 20 years, from my old farmhouse to a temporary bed to my new farmhouse and bloomed many blossoms even on years when I transplanted it. The roots I left behind at my old house were up and blooming the very next year. Blooms smack dab in the middle of the season and has blooms for about 3 weeks. The flowers are enormous and in spite of strong stems, will droop, sometimes breaking over the edge of a peony hoop. Get very long supports for a very large hoop (you can buy them separately at Kinsman) and be ready to cut them right before or after a rain.

I find some are downright unpleasant. Not only is 'Festiva Maxima' the most fragrant, but (at least to my nose) it's the sweetest, with the best quality of fragrance, not heavy or musky.\nStems are long and the heavy flowers will sprawl on the ground without support. Peony hoops set in early in the season are the easiest way to support them.\nAs with all peonies, the eyes (underground growing tips) need light to form flower buds, and should not be covered by more than an inch of soil if you want flowers.\n... read more\nPositive\nOn May 17, 2013, laineygirl from Mountain Top, PA wrote:\nExquisitely fragrant!

It's flowers, though fragrant, are inconspicuous. Grapelike berries produced by the female plant are edible and ripen in fall. Train this vine to cover a fence or arbor, it can grow to twenty feet. Cats can be attracted to it's leaves, shredding them happily.\nPost a comment about this plant"

The number of buds per stem depends on the age of the bulb, and lenght of time planted in one spot. The bigger the bulb is, the more buds are present. Plant oriental lilies in full sun as leaves and buds form. Once buds begin to form, move in partial shade to protect the bloom from discoloring or drying out.\nI personally feed the bulb during planting time with superphosphate and foliar feed with MG 15-30-15 once a week, during growing season until the leaves turn brown.

This is my first experience with hellebores (I have three H. orientalis as well) here in coastal Northern CA/Sunset zone 17, and it looks like they are very consistent bloomers for well over half a year.

Have had success with growing this in full sun (moist soil) in rocks above my pond.\nPositive\nOn Sep 7, 2004, BingsBell from SC, MT (Zone 5a) wrote:\nBeautiful large hosta that gets bigger each year in every way.

Sadly the plant is colonial, so if you plant it, put a barrier in the ground or be ready for a forest.\nTransplanting is best done when the plant's gone dormant (note the fine, silvery membrane covering the stems)- in the middle of winter: go dig up a wild one. The roots don't go too far down, but move sideways... just chop off the next plant down.\nBe warned- the sap is really sticky, and your hands will be a bit mucky if you mess with the plant.

I would highly recommend this tree to anyone searching for a medium sized tree and doesn't mind waiting a while for it to reach a mature size.\nThe Shantung Maple is a slow growing tree, so don't expect a nice shade tree after 10-15 years. It also naturally branches low to the ground, so it should not be planted next to roads or sidewalks as it may, in time, obstruct the path. Removing the lower branches can be done without hurting the health of the tree, but the natural form of the tree may be permanently marred in doing so.

I have 'Fire Dragon' which produces consistent fall color. Great tree. I have grown a lot of seedlings from seeds and they all have different leaf shapes and also different summer growth color. Very interesting to watch how they turn out. Most of them have bright yellow fall color and none had red ones so that should tell you that it is rare to find true consistent red fall color from shantung maples.\nVery tough tree that can tolerate heat, wind, ice and drought!

Acer truncatum is quite different from Acer mono, which is sometimes called Acer truncatum ssp. mono.

Good seasonal color with purples leaves in spring fading to dark green. Somewhat drought tolerant. Leaves can scorch in hot sun and wind.

I have noticed there are lots of little babies popping up in the grass around my tree so it can sucker although I think these are from seeds, not roots.

I thought I would not find the rough bark appealing, yet now I have fallen to its allure, loving it as much as any other Maple's bark. There is a slight hint of a purplish striation within the ridges which also adds to the appeal. Fall color can be very good, but it is the purplish-red unfolding young leaves that give this tree its name and makes it famous. It is a sight to behold indeed.

The roots are very fine and have formed a very dense \"ball\" about 12\" deep and extending outward slightly past the perimeter of the plant. The roots are so dense, in fact, that it was difficult to remove the plant when I re-built the filter this spring due to the amount of gravel they'd \"captured\". The bright yellow flowers in spring are an added bonus, but the excellent filtering of the water by the root system is the main reason I planted this- and it appears to be doing a great job. The water in the bog filter freezes solid in the winter, but the Marsh Marigold is the first plant to reappear in the spring.\nPositive\nOn Jun 22, 2010, genshiro from Whitby,\nCanada wrote:\nI consider this plant a 'must have' for any water garden.

Unfortunately, the flower color is strongly connected to how much sun the plant gets, so flowers on cut branches will bloom out lighter and lighter colors as the display sits inside.\nOnce established the shrub will both spread out and spread by shoots coming up from the roots.

I have 4 of them, planted about 9 years ago - they get dappled morning shade and then full shade in the middle of the day, and then back to dappling. The clumps are beautiful and there is no scorching in this lighting.\nPositive\nOn Sep 19, 2014, anelson from Birchwood, WI (Zone 3b) wrote:\nThis is indeed a plant which performs best when sited correctly. In cooler climates like mine in Northern Wisconsin, it really shines when given morning sun - the contrast between the center and border of the leaf is stunning! But, I can imagine that, in warm climates, afternoon sun would scorch it.\nPositive\nOn Jun 5, 2009, wendymadre from Petersburg, VA wrote:\nMy garden is situated in Petersburg, South Central Virginia, Zone 7. Because I've seen most hostas mainly in small pots for sale (I need to tour more shade gardens), I was surprised at the size that they attain after several years. I know that the information about their size is printed out on labels, but their lushness in the leaf is still a wonder. After all, not everything in my garden thrives or even survives. Gold Standard is a refreshing addition to my shade bed. A hosta breeder told me that there is a saying about hostas: \"The first year they sleep, the second they creep, the third year they leap.\" Yep, Gold Standard is leaping, all right. Just lovely.\nNeutral\nOn Aug 22, 2008, Gabrielle from (Zone 5a) wrote:\nBurns easily.

In that location the leaves of the Gold Standard bleached and browned.\nWhen I moved the plant back into a location that received only indirect sun it soon began growing new leaves. It has continued to grow very well in that lighting condition while retaining the variety's beautiful vibrant yellow coloring.\nPositive\nOn Jan 1, 2005, lmelling from Ithaca, NY (Zone 5b) wrote:\nI purchased a 'gold standard' and planted it back in 2000 in my lower garden. For several years it did so-so in the area I had it in where it received partial sun but was planted in moist heavy clay and wasn't particularly happy. The foliage faded to a sickly goldish color in the sun.\nI moved it to it's present location in spring of 2003 - rich loam and dappled sunlight part of the day - and it has gone crazy ever since. It's size has increased dramatically and coloration is outstanding. It brightens up the whole shade garden (see the photo). I didn't realize how beautiful this old cultivar is until I moved it to the shade! Now the centers stay a much richer light green with the darker margins and it will occasionally throw an odd varigation.\nPositive\nOn Apr 26, 2004, Cheryl_IL from (Zone 5b) wrote:\nGold Standard is one of my favorites for the way its leaves change color. It can have multiple shaded leaves at the same time. Sometimes it gets quite a bit of sun where I have it.\nNeutral\nOn Mar 4, 2003, jody from MD &, VA (Zone 7b) wrote:\nFlower scapes to 42\".

We've had this one planted in full sun for three years now and it just keeps on flowering. We did have a problem with nematodes which were causing the plant to decline from the outside (tips) in. It had been looking so wonderful and I couldn't figure out what was happening. We have a good friend who's very knowledgeable about all plants in Florida, and he diagnosed nematodes. He told me to take some cuttings and re-plant them when they started to show new growth. I planted the successful cuttings in October '09 and those little babies made it through our freezes this year and, although they are not currently flowering, I have faith that they will. I planted several cuttings together for a \"single\" plant.\nThis plant seems to need to get to a ... read more\nNegative\nOn Jan 19, 2010, cloverlymd from Silver Spring, MD wrote:\nIn my garden (Md.) this has been scrawny and didn't bloom much considering its size.\nPositive\nOn May 27, 2008, Fleurs from Columbia, SC wrote:\nHoneycomb's flowers begin the summer shaped almost like balls, but as the summer progresses, the flowers lengthen until they resemble the ordinary trusses associated with butterfly gardens.\nMy only complaint is one of my own making: the shrub must contend with my neighbor's very thirsty maple roots.

I cut it down every spring to 50 cm and it runs out to a firm bush of 200 cm again. I keep it deadheading while it blooms. Butterflies and bees love it too. It has a strong honeyscent which you also expect with the colour. It's very easy to maintain and very droughtresistant and disease-/crittersfree. Last winter we had frosts down to -20 C and it came out perfect. I live in the Netherlands in a zone 8a. it was sold to me as a Budleia globosa, but it turned out not to be one (I think).\nPositive\nOn Oct 3, 2003, TerriFlorida from Plant City, FL wrote:\nHm. I was warned when I bought this one that it could get seven feet tall. Is that short? I sent for it from S. Carolina, I live in west central Florida, zone 9b most of the time. I planted this bush last November. We had our usual winter regarding 2-3 frosts, but unusual in that it rained a lot. (Our usual rainy season is summer.) Honeycomb bloomed all winter, all spring, and all summer. I cut it back in August, later than I'd intended. It's blooming again now. For all I know, this bush could be short-lived down here. But its very fragrant, unusual flowers were VERY welcome all last winter! Many little native bees visited it, many sulfur butterflies did too.\nPositive\nOn Jun 1, 2003, lauburt from Vancouver, WA wrote:\nA different butterfly bush for a couple of reasons. One is that the bloom is in small, roundish sections instead of long and cone-like. The second is that is doesn't grow quite as tall as some other varieties, which can be nice in a smaller space. Flowers still have the same, sweet scent. I like this one a lot!\nPost a comment about this plant"
