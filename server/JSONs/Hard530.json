Some come in a little earlier or later than most and we are glad to have extended the season a bit.

There are many places where you can find the fruits on the ground, though I don't recommend eating them from the ground, as they are usually chewed by squirrels, pecked by birds, or hollowed out by insects. On occasion, you may get lucky and find one untouched, thought it is still a good idea to wash it.\nThey can also be trained up certain trees for a unique appearance. A one or two decades old muscadine grown up a tree with lots of irrigation can produce a very twisted, tropical liana look, even with occasional aerial roots.\nBe careful with young trees, however, as the vine can overpower and stunt the tree's growth if not cut at the ground at least twice a year.

The cooler weather helps it last longer than the later-blooming tulips.\nIt's an excellent perennial and naturalizer here, where most tulips peter out in a year or two. (Tulips require a dry summer rest, and here in Boston Z6a we get too much summer rainfall for most tulips to perennialize.

A year later to my surprise I found three tulips poking through the soil where the excavation had taken place. They have bloomed without fail to this day. A large shrub next to them has grown into their space. So they will be moved for the first time in 20+ years to a new location with more sun and less crowded conditions.

It's invasive in New York, and frankly this cultivar is just hideously ugly, in my opinion. The last thing I want to see coming out of a long, cold Buffalo winter is long rows of dark, dark red trees down each side of the street. Please, my fellow Buffalonians, no more Crimson Kings!!\nPositive\nOn May 14, 2008, warrendavisx from Haddonfield, NJ wrote:\nOne of my prize maples, it is strikingly beautiful as it leafs out in Spring and provides welcome shade relief for conversations with neighbors. It was already here and mature when I moved in ten years ago, and has been a stable and placid fixture at the very front of the property. No problems at all, and would never want to lose it. No problem growing hostas, St John's wort and vinca underneath, except that mature trees leave little room between the roots (so plant youngest specimens). The roots are mostly underground with just two bumps visible. Although the area is mostly acidic, it sits next to a concrete sidewalk and a street corner without a problem.\nNegative\nOn Aug 27, 2007, fob from Pickerington, OH wrote:\nVery nice color; shows well in the spring and early summer. However, late summer (Zone 6), it gets infected with insects which eat 1/3rd the leaves (bugs wrap in a cacoon about 1-1/2 inches longs and triangular shape; brown color).

I've seen a good number in northwest Indiana and east central Indiana too. Sometimes found in residential yards. I've seen it doing well in barely acid soils, as those of the limestone derived soils around Downingtown, PA. It has lighter gray bark than the European Beech and larger leaves, and much fewer cultivars. It is not as adaptable as the European species to refined landscapes with lawn and more alkaline pH reaction.

Stems are usually purple and leaves can also be purple-tinged, more so if it's suffering from a shortage of water.Peppermint leaves are used in herbal teas and salads.

I remember my Great-grandmother having several rows of gooseberries. But those were always Ribes of whatever species. Generally geooseberries are Ribes with fruit much larger than currants and colored green, gold or blush pink. I know how varied common names are, but this one confuses me bcause sweetspires are native and gooseberries are very traditional and common.\nPositive\nOn Jun 25, 2007, braun06 from Peoria Heights, IL (Zone 5b) wrote:\nThis plant has been very easy to grow in fairly good shade. In my area depending on soil it can take on some yellowing from high ph soils but is easily correctible. Mine has established very well in one year and has grown quite quickly in its second year. Henry's Garnet is very handsome in leaf and in flower. It has very nice fall coloration too. I have noticed one of my branches has developed a mutation that the leaves are now variegated. They are mottled in different patterns green, creme, and white. When the summer gets warmer some light rose shading occurs on these leaves as well.\nNeutral\nOn Sep 4, 2001, Terry from Murfreesboro, TN (Zone 7a) wrote:\nThis plant has fragrant attractive racemes of white flowers in mid-Summer, followed by green berries which turn brownish purple.\nIf given moist soil, it will sucker vigorously, and may spread beyond where it was intended.

A large nursery nearby is selling these plants and they are so buautiful, I bought one. They told me it will grow here, in zone 8, 77381. I have planted it in well drained sandy soil, raised bed, with only morning sun, then somewhat dappled. I will report the ongoing results, but if anyone who frequents this site has experience in the same area, please let me know about it - especially if there's something specific I need to do.

My original planting is still going strong, despite having not been divided or given any special attention (except for an annual haircut to remove dead foliage when I happen to not overlook it) for 10+ years! I really like the horizontal banding of the leaf blades, but the habit of 'Zebrinus' is not the best. Basically, it flops--both figuratively and literally. It will stand strong when it first emerges and continue as such into the summer but the closer it gets to plume time, the more and more it flattens out.

Leaves start out pinkish, turn to lime green and by flowering are a leaf-green. Bright pink, umbellic flowers bloom for a good time, and will re-flower in late summer if you clip the faded flowers. In fall leaves delight again by turning an orange color. Stems are rust-colored in winter. VERY easy to grow. Will grow in neutral soil, but seems to very much enjoy acidic. Full sun to part shade. Can grow quickly, give room to spread, heavy pruning in early spring will also keep within bounds. Drought-tolerant when established, not bothered by any insects or diseases. Flowers are even pretty for cutting.\nNeutral\nOn Jul 3, 2003, Karenn from Mount Prospect, IL (Zone 5a) wrote:\n'Gold Flame' is somewhat larger in habit than 'Magic Carpet', which is a hybrid (or sport) of 'Gold Flame'.\nPositive\nOn Jul 2, 2003, dejavu from Rochester, NY wrote:\nThese are very popular around Rochester, NY.\nBeautiful show all spring-summer.
