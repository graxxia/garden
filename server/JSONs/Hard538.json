Definitely worth growing if you have the space - just put something sturdy in front of it so it doesn't flop about (I suspect having soil on the thin/poor side helps keep the growth in check.)\nNeutral\nOn Aug 14, 2001, gardendragon from Ladysmith, BC (Zone 8a) wrote:\nPruning: Deadheading plants before seed set can reduce prolific seeding, which may occur particularly in moist areas. First year seedlings may be desirable, though, as they are interesting, usually short 12 to 14 inches high plants with intense purple flowers and may be more attractive than the parent plant. When grown in rich moist soil, plants can tower to 9 feet tall, too large for many perennial gardens. Plants respond to a variety of pruning methods, to reduce their height, to create fuller plants, to stagger bloom time, or to layer plantings. One such method is to cut the plants down to the ground when they reach 2 feet tall, another is to cut plants back by 1 or 2 ft when they are 3-4 ft tall.\nInteresting native plant that prefers moist, slightly acidic conditions.

They are less prone to disease and iris borer than tall bearded iris, require division less frequently, and perform better under crowded border conditions. Most garden centers carry only the old 'Caesar's Brother' and 'Butter and Sugar'.\nHowever, there's been a great deal of progress in Siberian breeding since those two were introduced. Modern cultivars are more floriferous and bloom longer, many with larger flowers, and in a wider variety of colors (including not just white, violet, and true blue, but also yellow, wine red, mulberry, caramel, bronze, persimmon, cinnamon, pink, and slate gray).\nCheck out the winners of the Morgan-Wood Medal over the last twenty years: ... read more\nPositive\nOn Sep 18, 2011, appleflower from New York, NY wrote:\nTwo clumps of Siberian iris grow against the house on the north side (very shady) here at altitude 6800 feet altitude in northern New Mexico.

In the original species, they are in various shades of blue with white veining on the falls.

It then survived a brutal Texas summer of no rain receiving no rain for months and only 2 or three supplemental watering during the summer. It is planted in a limestone gravely soil that was amended with granite sand and compost. I thought it had dried to a crisp after its glorious flowering , but it greened up after the November rains and has grown larger and made many bloomstalks this spring. I LOVE IT against my artemisia \"Valery Finnis\" and Palaver rhoeas.I am planting more. I have some Standing cypress behind it reiterating its tall form in red. Very nice. Easy to grow from seed.

Bloom proceeds on the flower spikes from the bottom upwards, and the spikes continue to lengthen and produce new buds at the tip for month after month. No deadheading is necessary. If you cut the flower spike at the base, multiple secondary spikes will form.\nPrefers full sun and well drained soil.

Well, it's the only Hosta that I have ever lost (I have over 100 varieties), as it did not come back this year!

I got these at a clearance sale at a garden center and they were not cared for too well but were still bursting out of the pots. I figured they might be tough. The first year or two it was slow, but after the third year -- wow. I have some in semi-shade and even those turned into a huge clump well over 3 feet tall with multiple bloom spikes on each plant.

Iris borers are present but managed successfully with a granular systemic grub control product. Weeds are abundant and only occasionally beaten back by an admittedly lazy gardener (yours truly).

One misconception is that it needs a lot of water to survive. It does prefer water when coming out of its late dormancy (May-June in Zone 5). After it has become established, the plant is extremely drought tolerant. It has beautiful 10-12\" bright red, campanulate, flowers. When cut, place the flowers in water in the refrigerator until placing where desired to keep the flowers lasting longer. Cut the foliage back to the ground after a hard freeze to 3\" from the ground. This plant can also benefit from a 3-5 inches of mulch to help protect over cold winters. Remember that this plant breaks dormacy later than most plants so don't give up on it!\nPost a comment about this plant"

Anything in between full sun and full shade for me in Atlanta. With consistent moisture I bet it’ll take full sun. Otherwise I have it found it not to be as moisture- needy as it’s often described. Consistent, upright growth in different light levels. Durable foliage. Easily 2 months of bloom from aug-sept. I use hedge trimmers to cut it back by 1/3 in early summer, more flowers that way but not necessary. Spreads pretty quickly but not obnoxiously - no need to buy a large plant if you’re trying to save $$.\nGot a few Tiny Tortuga and they are as advertised - same plant but half the height.\nPositive\nOn Aug 28, 2015, Rickwebb from Downingtown, PA wrote:\nI have one big clump of this cultivar next to the east side of my house with morning full sun and afternoon shade that is doing well. It is growing in moist and sort of gooey clay soil next to an Inkberry Holly bush. It is very reliable and stands up well, at least when not in sites of strong winds. I have not had to stake it in about 6 years. Bumblebees will crawl into the flowers. It self sows just a little bit around. Easy to dig up and divide if wanting to propagate it. I believe it can be left undisturbed indefinitely. Native to the southern US.\nPositive\nOn Aug 30, 2010, ms_greenjeans from Hopkins, MN (Zone 4a) wrote:\nThis is a great, trouble-free, colorful shade plant. It blooms at a time when there isn't a lot going on, and the flowers are interesting and slightly-out-of-the-ordinary. The clumps expand each year but don't appear to be invasive; the stems are sturdy and don't require staking. The foliage is always glossy and nice looking. I haven't seen any pest or disease issues whatsoever, and the rabbits seem to leave it alone. I don't fertilize these at all and only water when it's extremely hot and dry. They even tolerate being under a gigantic cedar tree in the vicinity of black walnut trees. Definitely a winner.\nPositive\nOn Feb 28, 2010, VtRoots6440 from Montpelier, VT wrote:\nFound bunches of wild white/pink tinge Tur. Hds in wetland behind our camp; grabbed a couple & they didn't transplant well. Was early fall at Gren. Hs. & saw huge Pink Turtle Heads on sale for $4. a gallon pot 8 yrs. ago. But the bees struggling to get into those bright pink \"snap-dragon type\" blossoms had me grinning, and hooked. However, that single plant has been divided 4 times in those 8 yrs. as it grows huge within two yrs. So like my white bleeding & pink bleeding hearts, I've divided many times for my home & camp gardens & given away many of same. Both prefer afternoon shade, but my T.Hds. still bloom like crazy on the hot front garden, but are well watered when home from summer camp once a wk. And the bee \"bump & grind\" for this late summer plant still makes me laugh. It's a fun-l... read more\nPositive\nOn Jun 9, 2008, grik from Saint Paul, MN wrote:\nThis plant really comes into its own late in the season when not much else good is going on in my garden. The foliage is deep green and looks nice all year. It slowly spreads when its happy but is by no means aggressive. This is a great plant.\nPositive\nOn May 18, 2008, mrickett from Lawrenceville, GA wrote:\nGreat plant! It is attractive to hummingbirds, butterlies and bees. I have three plants that are several years old. They maintain a nice shape and do not fall over in wind or rain. The foliage is very attractive.\nPositive\nOn Oct 30, 2007, ifonly from Brookfield, CT wrote:\nThis is a terrific plant - glossy dark green leaves first attracted me. Flowers are great & last a long time. Mine grow in full blasting sun, and the soil is NOT consistently moist, but rather dry. Altogether a great late bloomer, good with cotinus Velvet Cloak, deep blue/purple aconitum, and shasta daisy Becky.\nPositive\nOn Apr 12, 2007, terrelevin from Saugerties, NY wrote:\nI saw this shrub at a garden shop and watched as bumble bees 'forced' their way into the blossom. All you could see of the bee was its rear end. It was funny and gorgeous all at the same time. I knew then, I had to have this plant.\nPost a comment about this plant"
