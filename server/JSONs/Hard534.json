I've been very pleased. Even though my area is considered Zone 5, we are right in the mountains, so some winters are much colder. Consequently, I really have to plant for Zone 4. I was dubious they would survive, but I planted them against the garage wall with western exposure. Because of the garage they are in the shade until mid morning, but then they receive sun the rest of the day and get the really hot afternoon west sunlight. They seem to love it! I've never pampered them, and only cut them back in the early spring. I've never divided them. The soil is amended clay, so not great soil either. They do get regular water twice a week from the sprinkler system which he... read more\nPositive\nOn Jun 30, 2011, ctlandscaper from Long Hill, CT wrote:\nZebra Grass is no doubt my favorite of all ornamental grasses.

My original planting is still going strong, despite having not been divided or given any special attention (except for an annual haircut to remove dead foliage when I happen to not overlook it) for 10+ years! I really like the horizontal banding of the leaf blades, but the habit of 'Zebrinus' is not the best. Basically, it flops--both figuratively and literally. It will stand strong when it first emerges and continue as such into the summer but the closer it gets to plume time, the more and more it flattens out. I do like my 'Zebrinus,' but I wish it stay more upright like its cousin 'Strictus.' Still a fine grass!\nNeutral\nOn May 13, 2010, vmadison from Louisville, KY wrote:\nMy zebra grass is growing well, but it has no stripes. Has anyone experienced this? If so, what causes this?

Suceptible to mildew and may need to be treated during the summer.\nTo dry: cut when the flowers are well open but before the oldest flowes on the stem start to show signs of browning.

It differs from Gold Mound in having red foliage at the top in spring besides bright yellow. When the heat of summer comes, it turns totally yellow-green like the other. It does get good reddish fall color. It does not bear a good display of pink flowers. It is also overused.

Leaves start out pinkish, turn to lime green and by flowering are a leaf-green. Bright pink, umbellic flowers bloom for a good time, and will re-flower in late summer if you clip the faded flowers. In fall leaves delight again by turning an orange color. Stems are rust-colored in winter. VERY easy to grow. Will grow in neutral soil, but seems to very much enjoy acidic. Full sun to part shade. Can grow quickly, give room to spread, heavy pruning in early spring will also keep within bounds. Drought-tolerant when established, not bothered by any insects or diseases. Flowers are even pretty for cutting.\nNeutral\nOn Jul 3, 2003, Karenn from Mount Prospect, IL (Zone 5a) wrote:\n'Gold Flame' is somewhat larger in habit than 'Magic Carpet', which is a hybrid (or sport) of 'Gold Flame'.\nPositive\nOn Jul 2, 2003, dejavu from Rochester, NY wrote:\nThese are very popular around Rochester, NY.\nBeautiful show all spring-summer.

Once-blooming, in early summer. The hips are large and showy when they ripen in autumn.\nI have seen this many times, but always as an upright shrub to 4-5' and never as a climber. It has an open suckering habit that is not aggressive and mixes well with herbaceous underplanting.\nIt is highly resistant to disease, and especially to black spot. Even here in black spot hell, this can be grown without fungicide.\nThe upper canes are nearly thornless.

It tends to take over in areas where the soil has recently been disturbed. It will also poison the soil and crowd out other species. It's a beautiful plant, when it's kept contained and under control. But be careful, because it can get out of hand, very quickly. I have a stand of it growing along the edge of the woods behind my house. It will get up to 8 feet tall. If it starts to get out of hand, it seems to stay under control if you just pull the shoots out of the ground, and then keep them trimmed. However, once it gets rooted in a certain area, I don't think it ever truly goes away.\nIt grows very quickly, so I imagine it would make a fine privacy screen.

I am growing it as a climber on a trellis, from ground up to a second story deck, and continuing up the sides of the deck railing. Very vigorous grower and bloomer. It responds extremely well to pruning, which I do in March and then after the first big bloom, plus tidying at end of summer. I deadhead regularly. It seems immune to disease, even last spring and summer, which started out so cold and wet my other roses just dropped their spotty leaves in disgust (I don't use sprays).

As you are going remove old decaying matter as well as strands that are no longer productive. The secret to making very fresh new looking plants is to plant it a little deeper than normal.

It is toxic unless prepared by someone who knows the traditional methods of reducing the toxicity using ginger or salts.

Not all Canterbury Bells spread, though. I unwittingly ordered one that's aggressive, and nowhere in the description was this mentioned. Lucky for me, I keep a raised bed for trying out new plants so I can see exactly what they will do so I can find the best place for them. This one just zoomed all the way across one end of the bed it's first year-not even it's blooming year!

The stems are also very brittle, so that as I am attempting to mulch, weed or contain these plants whole stems break off. Pretty but disappointing.\nPositive\nOn May 27, 2011, annlof from Camarillo, CA wrote:\nNew flower buds often form right at the base of the first flowers.

Beautiful, very full blue-green foliage from the dirt to the top.

The color is a medium pink and while the individual roses are not stunning on their own, the effect of the full sprays covering the bush is wonderful to see. This rose lived happily through the last two winters of arctic freezes in my zone 5 garden with no protection at all. This is a great rose for a beginner; and experienced growers would love the ease of care and bursts of color from this hardy workhorse.

It's loaded with tons of blooms, zero diseases, even when other roses look bad in humid & rainy weather. At Cantigny rose park, I don't see thorns in Gene Boerner either.

They are less prone to disease and iris borer than tall bearded iris, require division less frequently, and perform better under crowded border conditions. Most garden centers carry only the old 'Caesar's Brother' and 'Butter and Sugar'.\nHowever, there's been a great deal of progress in Siberian breeding since those two were introduced. Modern cultivars are more floriferous and bloom longer, many with larger flowers, and in a wider variety of colors (including not just white, violet, and true blue, but also yellow, wine red, mulberry, caramel, bronze, persimmon, cinnamon, pink, and slate gray).\nCheck out the winners of the Morgan-Wood Medal over the last twenty years: ... read more\nPositive\nOn Sep 18, 2011, appleflower from New York, NY wrote:\nTwo clumps of Siberian iris grow against the house on the north side (very shady) here at altitude 6800 feet altitude in northern New Mexico.

I haven't had any pest problems. It can withstand some drought and poor soil, although I'm sure it would do better in moist soil. I've also grown it as a pond plant on a shallow ledge.

The slender, sword-like, midgreen leaves die down in winter. The flowers are about 2 1/2 inches wide and are borne during midsummer. In the original species, they are in various shades of blue with white veining on the falls. Because the original species hybridizes freely, only hybrids are usually available.\nCultivation: Grows best in moist soil, but will also perform well in a herbaceous border, where it usually does not grow so high. lant rhizomes 1 inch deep in the soil in autumn or spring.\nPropagation: Easily increased by lifting and dividing every four to five years.\nPost a comment about this plant"
