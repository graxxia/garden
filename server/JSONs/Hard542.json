The weight of the flowers would cause the branches to sag down to the ground, and if it rained, the water in all those flowers at the end of the branches would inevitably weight them down into the mud.\nAlso, in my garden it proved susceptible to black spot.

Despite this, it has bloomed beautifully.

This seems like relatively slow growth, however, the years have sped by, and I don't feel they've done poorly in growth. They all seem drought resistant, very hardy and one even survived a small grass fire. The small 2-3\" cones resemble those of the Norway Spruce and the White Spruce in size and color.

The replacement is now just as tall as the other plants. Next year I plan to pinch them back in late spring in an attempt to prevent the need for staking.\nUpdate 2010:\nI have been cutting the plants back to about 8\" high in late May/early June for several years now.

Be careful with pruning/deadheading. Only remove spent bloom, NOT the entire stalk -- you will remove newly growing buds and greatly decrease flowering time. Avoid moving plant around, its roots do best when left undisturbed. Also, not a good choice around annuals for this reason. VERY long lived once established and low-maintenance.

When removing it from an area, care must be taken to get every shred of the stuff....even then it will take several seasons to rid it completely from a planting space. It produces a vast number of seeds that can lay dormant for great lengths of time and still remain viable.\nThe name Smartweed comes from the sap that sometimes causes ittitation when it comes in contact with the skin.\nThe seeds are attractive to songbirds and wildlife, but there are many plants that are less invasive that can serve that purpose....and this stuff is never going to be put on any endangered list.\nPost a comment about this plant"

The blackening also indicates perhaps there is some root rot going on and you may want to insure that the soil is properly draining. If not, replant your vine and raise its position a foot above the current soil level. Use some crushed granite in the mix to promote better aeration as well as drainage. First, however, we know that this plant grows better in slightly acidic to moderately alkaline soil .

It is beautiful spring, summer, and fall. In spring, it starts as a little mottled red mound that grows into a lovely green with yellow stars on top. In the summer it matures to a pretty forest green with hints of orangish-red on the tips. In fall, it turns fiery red which lasts well past the first few frosts.\nI have 3 in full sun on a south-facing wall, and 1 in partial shade on an obscured walkway on the northwest side of the house (only receives 2 hours of afternoon sun). All thrive and prefer to be left alone (they die quickly if over-watered). My hose occasionally clips a stem or 2, which I place into a little container of potting soil, and, voila, a new little plant emerges. So easy! Love this little guy.\nPositive\nOn Jun 9, 2014, JenDion from Litchfield, NH (Zone 5b) wrote:\nThis plant is amazing. It starts out plum/burgundy in the spring, flowers chartreuse-yellow that almost complete covers the plant, then when you cut it back (so it doesn't flop open after flowering), it has blue-green lower leaves (I cut mine back to 6\" or so).

H. x sternii is a cross between H. lividus and H. argutifolius. It is disease resistant as well as rabbit and deer resistant.

It is a good quality and handsome tree, but is often over-planted. It must have an acid soil of pH 6.8 or below; otherwise, it develops iron chlorosis, and slowly yellows and dies. It grows in bottomlands and the scientific Latin name means Swamp Oak, thus it suffers in strong drought.

Especially valuable for getting colors other than yellow in the late summer garden.\nHeleniums need consistently moist soils. They are wet soil plants in the wild and are less tolerant of drought than most border plants. Drought stress contributes to their proneness to powdery mildew.\nMost cultivars get tall enough to topple over. This can be mitigated by pinching the growing tips towards the end of May. Alternatively, you can cut them back hard later, in midsummer, as hard as 12\". You can pinch most stems in May and later give a hard cut to the stems towards the front of the clump, which will help prolong the bloom season and cover the often leafless legs.\nDivide in early spring as needed.\nPositive\nOn Oct 16, 2008, Malus2006 from Coon Rapids, MN (Zone 4a) wrote:\nBecoming more commonly planted in gardens - I just saw a wild patch at O'Brien State Park in Minnesota - it is a single plant that was somewhat beaten up because it was on the edge of a path - it is growing in some grasses near a stream which means that it like wet areas.
